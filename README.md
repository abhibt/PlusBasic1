Intent of the project
This is an application meant for the delivery boys.
When the delivery boy takes bunch of items to delivery, the delivery person is given a set of addresses.
The application needs those addresses and in google maps, the entire map will be provided.

Also using google maps, shortest path algorithm, the entire route is provided.
It used google authentication, google address search, google maps apis.

This I did for my MTECH project.
